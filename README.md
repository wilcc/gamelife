## GameLife- Life's a game and game life is a different life

### This App was designed to make keeping track of everyday life chores a little more interesting.

After you clone and npm install all the packages. You can host this app on your local server.

On the main page you will see a todo list, a dailies list and a 'shop'.
You can add things you want to be done to the todo list, once you complete the task the item will be removed and your character will gain exp and gold. You can also delete the task, but you will not gain anything from it. 

If it's something you would be doing everyday repetitively, you can add it to the dailies list, where everything functions the same as the todo list but after you complete the task it will not be removed from the list, and it would reset on 00:00AM everyday so you can complete it again the next day.

After you gain enough gold, you can purchase weapon and armor for you character, or you can buy potions which recover your lost HP.

On the top you can see a NavBar which different tabs. 
Task- Our main page with the todo and dailies list.
Item- One Stop Shop where you can purchase all the items you want
Dungeons- Where you encounter monsters. You can gain exp and gold by defeating them. Beware some might be stronger than others. The stronger they are, the better of rewards. You can only defeat each monster once a day.
